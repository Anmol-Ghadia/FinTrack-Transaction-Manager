# _GateSim_
> Design, simulate and visualize logical circuits.

### About

_GateSim_ is a software application that allows users to create and simulate digital circuits. 
It has a graphical user interface for designing and observing circuits. 
It includes basic logic gates like **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **NAND**, in addition to more advanced gates. 
The project's distinguishing feature is that it is focused on visualizing the circuits. 
The project's goal is to give users a hands-on understanding of how digital circuits work, 
and it can be used for both educational purposes and small-scale prototyping of digital circuits.

### Intended Audience:
Although anyone is free to use the application as they see fit, the project's goal is to provide **students** with an 
excellent and robust learning tool that can help them:
* learn to design circuits
* understand behaviour of various components
* learn the interaction and purpose of each component

### Motivation for the project
I've always enjoyed playing with logic circuit simulators, but most of them fail to take
advantage of the visual aspect. With this project, I aim to accomplish much more in that area.
And, in the process, provide a resource for other students to better grasp the concepts.
Furthermore, the project will without a doubt allow me to get more insights and help deepen my understanding.

### User Stories
* **Phase 0**
  1. As a user, I want to be able to add a logic gate to a circuit.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to create a new circuit.
  3. As a user, I want to have some example circuits.
  4. As a user, I want to be able to add a wire to connect components on the circuit.
  5. As a user, I want to be able to view the logical state of a component/wire on the circuit.
  6. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all components on a circuit.
