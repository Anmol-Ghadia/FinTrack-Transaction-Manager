# FinTrack
> Track your expenses and plan your budget

### About
FinTrack is a personal finance tracing software application that allows users to manage their personal finances.
It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to record their expenses and income, and to keep track of their budget.
The application also offers features such as categorizing expenses, creating a budget plan, and generating reports on spending habits.
The goal of the project is to help users take control of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending.

### Intended Audience
The intended audience for this application is anyone who wants to improve their financial situation and have a better understanding of their spending habits. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for people who are just starting to manage their finances, as well as those who want to keep track of their expenses in a more organized and efficient manner.

### Motivation for the project
The motivation for this project comes from the personal experience of managing finances and struggling to keep track of expenses. I aim to provide a tool that makes it easy for people to manage their finances, so they can focus on saving and investing their money, instead of worrying about how to keep track of it.
